        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Formed in 2019 in Central Florida, 2AMature is a four‑piece alternative
          punk/garage rock band. The lineup consists of
          <strong>Geomar Berube</strong> (lead vocals &amp; guitar),
          <strong>Micah Elmer</strong> (lead guitar),
          <strong>Brian Alvarez</strong> (bass) and
          <strong>Yanmark Berube</strong> (drums &amp; backing vocals). Their
          playful name nods to late‑night jam sessions that solidified the band
          and their unapologetically DIY spirit.
        </p>

          The group blends punk energy with garage‑rock grit and surf‑punk
          melodies, drawing inspiration from the music they grew up on as well
          as the vibrant Central Florida scene. In 2020 they released their
          debut EP <em>Life Guarding Elephant</em>,
          featuring the songs “Water Socks,” “Green Boots,” “Ouija Board,”
          “Birthday” and “Daylight Debt.” Since then they’ve continued to write
          and record music that embraces spontaneity and humour without
          sacrificing musicianship.

          Known locally as “The Best Band in the Universe,” 2AMature’s shows are
          equal parts sweaty punk spectacle and friendly hangout. Whether
          performing at their home base Uncle Lou’s Entertainment Hall or at
          DIY venues across the region, they foster an inclusive atmosphere
          where crowds can dance, surf and sing along. In 2025 they released
          the two‑song single <em>Can’t Be Friends</em>, following the 2024
          single “Chef Boyz” and 2022’s
          <em>DCxPC Live Volume&nbsp;1</em> split with Call in Dead. With
          each release the band tightens their surfy riffs and playful lyrics
          while staying true to their punk roots.
